# Contributing to 404 Elm Street

We are happy to accept your contributions to make 404 Elm Street! To avoid unnecessary work on either side, please follow these steps:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/zalando/elm-street-404/issues) for your feature/improvement.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion. We hate to close finished PRs!
3. If we decide that code changes are necessary, we would be happy to accept a pull request. Please consider the commit guidelines below.

In case you just want to help out and don't know where to start, [issues with "help wanted" label](https://github.com/zalando/elm-street-404/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) are good for first-time contributors.

## Git Commit Guidelines

If there is already a ticket, use this number at the start of your commit message. Use [semantic commit messages](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages):

* feat (new feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (changes to documentation)
* refactor (refactoring production code)
* test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
