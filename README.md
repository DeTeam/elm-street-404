You are Joe, the courier. It is your job, to deliver *all* the fashion to *all* the customers. Sometimes, you have to pick up stuff and return it to Zalando.

No problem.

However, customers keep ordering more and more — and your bicycle only has room for so many boxes...

To succeed, you'll have to plan your route carefully. You have to decide which packages to deliver in which order. And you really, really have to hurry. You'll find, that it's not as easy being a Zalandoer as you thought it was:

Unhappy customers: **you lose**.
